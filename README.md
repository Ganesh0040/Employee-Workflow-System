It sounds like you have a clear understanding of the different roles and functionalities within your Employee Workflow System application. To implement this system, you'll need to use a combination of front-end and back-end technologies. Here's a high-level overview of how you can structure the application:

Front-End:
Login Page:

Collect the user ID and password.
Authenticate the user by checking the entered credentials against the database.
Dashboards:

Implement four separate dashboards for Manager, HR, Admin, and Employee.
Manager Dashboard:

Allow managers to create, update, and assign tasks.
Provide a section for adding employee details, including a unique ID.
Enable managers to send requests to the admin for adding and updating employee details.
HR Dashboard:

Allow HR to update and delete existing employee details.
Enable HR to send requests to the admin for updating and deleting employee records.
Admin Dashboard:

Allow the admin to view and manage requests from managers and HR.
Display the type of request (create, update, delete) in the "Request For" column.
Provide options for the admin to allow or deny requests, with corresponding actions.
Employee Dashboard:

Allow employees to enter their ID and password.
Validate the entered credentials against the database.
If authenticated, redirect employees to the task section where they can view assigned tasks.
Back-End:
Authentication:

Implement a secure authentication system to verify user credentials.
Use a database to store unique IDs and hashed passwords for managers, HR, admins, and employees.
Database:

Create tables to store information about managers, HR, admins, employees, and tasks.
Establish relationships between tables (e.g., linking tasks to employees).
Request Handling:

Implement functionality to handle requests from managers and HR.
Allow the admin to review and act upon these requests.
Task Management:

Develop functionality to create, update, and delete tasks.
Associate tasks with employee IDs.
Security:

Implement secure coding practices, such as parameterized queries and proper input validation, to prevent SQL injection and other security vulnerabilities.
Session Management:

Implement session management to maintain user sessions securely.
APIs:

Develop APIs for communication between the front-end and back-end components.
Logging:

Implement logging for important actions and events to facilitate troubleshooting and auditing.
